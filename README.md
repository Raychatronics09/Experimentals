## Introduction
 Introduction
In the times of today, modernized industries have utilized the usage of robots to achieve tasks at a certain and desired efficiency for the sake of various aspects such as mass production or quality assurance but ultimately leads to product fabrications. Robots of today have many applications for a variety of tasks, however, certain robots can only do certain tasks and for this project, The Spherical Manipulator or Robot will be the main focus. The Spherical Manipulator is a manipulator that is made up of two rotary and one prismatic joint and, from the name itself, uses its links to perform spherical motions from a stationary position or fixed standpoint. To analyze the movement of the said manipulator, we use kinematic equations which have two different approaches. The two different approaches are Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics which are tackled in depth in the Forward and Inverse Kinematics section.

## Degrees of Freedom Description

The Degrees of Freedom refer to a system’s flexibility which in other words, is how freely the manipulator can move and interact with its surroundings. There are two main kinds of Mechanical Manipulators which are the Spatial and the Planar manipulators. Planar manipulators are usually limited to an ideal 3 degrees of freedom whilst Spatial Manipulators have an ideal of 6 degrees of freedom. This is because Planar manipulators can only ideally move at the 3 axes X, Y, and Z being translational movements while Spatial manipulators can, not only move at the three aforementioned axes but also rotate at each which adds up to ideally 6 having 3 translational movements, and 3 rotational movements. The Spherical manipulator is a spatial manipulator meaning that it has up to 6 degrees of freedom. However, this is not always the case as some manipulators can be described as Underactuated, meaning that they have less than the ideal degrees of freedom but they can also be described as Redundant meaning that they have more than the ideal degrees of freedom. Manipulators that don’t have this issue and have the right number of degrees of freedom are called Ideal Manipulators which in this case for the project that focuses on the Spherical Manipulator, it would have 6 degrees of freedom. To find the degrees of freedom of whichever manipulator, we use Grubler’s Criterion. [insert formula]. Since the project’s focus is the Spherical Manipulator, we use Grubler’s Criterion for Spatial Manipulators and solve it as follows: [Insert Computation]

This gives us the answer that our Spherical Manipulator has [insert M value] Degrees of Freedom and is [a/an] [Under-Actuated, Redundant, Ideal] Manipulator

## Kinematic Diagram

Kinematics is the study or the science of a system’s motion with disregard to other forces that may affect it and this becomes easier to figure out when we use a kinematic diagram. Kinematic diagrams give a view of the manipulator with its joints and links connected when their values are set to 0 or when their values are variables. In the case of the Spherical Manipulator, its kinematic diagram looks like this: [insert kinematic diagram]
